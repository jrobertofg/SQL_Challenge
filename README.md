# SQL_Challenge
Challenge 9 SQL 


In this challenge the objective is to design a database model with the tables in csv given. 
To have the Database please download the zip file and open it so you can have the database sql. 

Platforms used:
  -pgadmin 4 
  -Quick DBD app. 
  
In the first step the idea was to design the model that you will find in the file Quick DBD Model Image.
  For this step an scan of all the data analyze what every file contains and what type of data we are dealing with, it is important to know the variables and types so we can design the model. 
  This will give us what are the primary keys, and what are the fk so we can do the match inside the model. 

Second step code as in Quick DBD as in pg admin, so the variables and columns were defined. 
  In this step coding once we know the variables know what is conenected with what. Which variables are the primary keys and which are the foreign keys, what data is integer, which data is string, which data is an id. 
  once everything is identified the coding is much simpler to create the data base and the relations. once everything is into the file import the data to fill the tables with the infomration.
  after the data is filled and the variables, and keys are defined know we can do queries to know what information the data contains.  

The next step is start working with the information available to know what we can know in this case for example we could do queries to identify what workers belong to what deprtment, their salaries, how many men or women by department, how many people have the same name or last name. 

This are basic analyisis just that may be obtain through queries. you may see some of this queries done through challenge sql. If you recreate the model with the queries you will obtain the same results. for the queries listed afterwards. 

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee
List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986 
List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name 
List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name 
List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B
List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name ()
List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name ()
List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name) ()

Some difficulties found is to sometimes define the variables type and the keys if this are foreign or primary keys.
